BUILDING: This repository provides some classics machine learning tools in four fields: data preprocessing, unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised techniques. In addition, the three fields have two types of techniques: clustering/classification and outliers detection.  All algorithms are implemented in different programming languages: python, C, R, Scala and Java.
